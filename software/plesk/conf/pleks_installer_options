 Product and components installation options:
    --installation-type <type name>
                         Installs a predefined set of components.
                         This option can be used only for installing
                         a product. It is not available if a product version
                         is already installed on the server.

                         Examples:
                         1) install recommended set of components of the
                         latest generally available Plesk version:
                           --select-product-id plesk \
                           --select-release-latest --installation-type Recommended
                         2) install all components of the latest stable
                         Plesk version:
                           --select-product-id plesk --select-release-latest \
                           --tier stable --installation-type Full

    --install-component <component id>
                         Install the product component with specified
                         identifier. This option may be used for initial
                         product installation by specifying all required
                         components to install as well as for adding specified
                         components to an already existing installation.

                         Examples:
                         1) install Plesk 12.5.30 (example is shortened):
                           --select-product-id plesk \
                           --select-release-id PLESK_12_5_30 \
                           --install-component panel \
                           --install-component phpgroup \
                           --install-component web-hosting ...
                         2) add Tomcat Java support to installed Plesk:
                           --select-product-id plesk --select-release-current \
                           --install-component java

    --set-option <setting_name>=<setting_value>
                         Change a setting for a product component.
                         To view a list of all available settings, use
                         the option --show-options.

 Product and components removal options:
    --remove-component <component id>
                         Removes the product component with the specified
                         identifier.

                         Examples:
                         1) remove Horde Webmail from installed Plesk:
                           --select-product-id plesk --select-release-current \
                           --remove-component horde
                         2) replace QMail with Postfix in installed Plesk:
                           --select-product-id plesk --select-release-current \
                           --remove-component qmail --install-component postfix

    --remove-everything  Removes all components of the selected product version,
                         effectively uninstalling the product.

                         Example (uninstall Plesk):
                           --select-product-id plesk --remove-everything

    --upgrade-installed-components
                         Update or upgrade all installed components of the
                         selected product version.

                         Examples:
                         1) install latest updates for installed Plesk version:
                           --select-product-id plesk --select-release-current \
                           --upgrade-installed-components
                         2) upgrade to Plesk 12.5.30 from a previous version:
                           --select-product-id plesk \

                           --upgrade-installed-components

    --ignore-key-errors  Allow product upgrade even if license key is not
                         upgradable.

 Options for selecting a product and its version:
    --select-product-id <product id>
                         Select the product by specifying its identifier.
                         To see the list of all supported product identifiers,
                         use the --show-all-releases option.
                         This option is order-sensitive. If present, it must
                         be specified before any of the corresponding
                         --select-release-id, --select-release-latest or
                         --select-release-current options.

    --select-release-id <release id>
                         Use this option to specify the product version that you
                         want to install or whose properties you want to view.

    --select-release-latest
                         Select the latest product version available for
                         your operating system with the selected release tiers.

    --select-release-current
                         Select the same product version as the one installed
                         on your server.

    --tier <tiers>       Restrict available product versions to the latest ones
                         that belong to the selected release tiers. You can
                         specify multiple tiers by separating them with a comma.
                         For example: --tier stable,release,testing

    --all-versions       Do not filter available product versions by tiers they
                         belong to.
                         Starting from Plesk Installer 3.11, every product
                         version is associated with one or several release tiers.
                         By default, only the latest versions from the
                         "stable,release,current" tiers as well as the
                         currently installed product version are shown.
                         You can use this option to work with the Installer
                         disregarding the release tiers scheme.

 Options for listing entities available at installation source:
    --show-releases      Specify this option to retrieve a list of available
                         product versions for the operating system where the
                         Plesk Installer is executed. You will be given a list
                         of release identifiers, descriptions, and their tiers.
                         A product identifier from the first column may be used
                         as an argument to the --select-product-id option.
                         A release identifier from the second column may be used
                         as an argument to the --select-release-id option.
                         Release tiers may be used as an argument to the
                         --tier option.

    --show-all-releases  This option shows all product versions available from
                         the installation source. Output format is the same
                         as for the --show-releases option.

    --show-os-list       Use this option to find out on which operating systems
                         the product version you selected can run.

    --show-installation-types
                         Show the names of predefined sets of components
                         for the selected product version.

    --show-components    Use this option to obtain the information on the
                         components available for the selected product version.
                         Component names, installation status, and descriptions
                         will be displayed.
                         You need to specify component names when selecting
                         components with the --install-component or
                         --remove-component options.

    --show-upgradable-components
                         Use this option to obtain the information on the
                         installed components which have available updates.
                         Component names, installation status, and descriptions
                         will be displayed.

    --show-options       This option can be used only with the --show-components
                         and --show-upgradable-components options. Use it if you
                         want to view available installation settings.

    --show-packages      Do not actually perform components installation,
                         removal, update or upgrade. Instead show packages that
                         will be installed, updated or removed, marked with
                         [I], [U], and [R] respectively.
